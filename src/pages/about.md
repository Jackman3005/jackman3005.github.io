**Hello folks! Welcome to `code crazy`**

# Background
My name is Jack Coy. I grew up in a small farm town in Michigan about an hour away from Detroit.
After high school I studied Computer Science at Eastern Michigan University. During my time at EMU, 
I started my professional career at a software consultancy called [Menlo Innovations](http://menloinnovations.com/).
Not initially understanding what I was getting myself into, I quickly found out that Menlo 
is a passionate advocate of [Extreme Programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/).
For those who have forgotten, Extreme Programming (XP) is a flavor of agile software development that is 
most known for its short (1 week) iterations, [Pair Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html), 
and [Test Driven Development](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html).
Till this day, I am certain there was no faster way for me to get ramped up into professional software
development than pairing 8 hours a day with someone who actually knew what they were doing. The
learning intensity was truly invigorating! After two and half years at Menlo Innovations I had completed my
undergraduate degree at EMU.

At the time, I felt that school ended abruptly for me and I was seeking more. I enrolled in the
Computer Science Masters program at the University of Colorado - Boulder. My experience at UC
was fantastic. I was able to get a position as a Teachers Assistant where I taught undergraduate
computer science classes. This helped me realize my hidden passion for teaching. I met some great people
and took some excellent classes. Most notably:

- Machine Learning
- Deep Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing
- Ethical Hacking (all-time favorite class)

At the end of my first year in the masters program I got a job at [Pivotal Labs](https://pivotal.io/labs).
Originally planning to stay only for the summer break, I ended up getting thoroughly distracted by life 
in the professional scene. My intentions of completing a masters degree eluded me...

After two and a half years at Pivotal in Boulder, I relocated to the [Pivotal office in Sydney](https://pivotal.io/locations/sydney) 
in September of 2017.

After nearly 7 years with Pivotal Labs working with some of the best people on the planet I took a leap of faith
in January 2022 and joined [Sascha Reuter](https://twitter.com/sreuter)'s startup to work on [Questmate](https://www.questmate.com/).

# Intentions

Over the years I have had a number of experiences that I thought the rest of the world
may be interested in. I've mostly been too lazy to share these, but I've started to realize
that some of my experiences are close to unique and there are people that
would love to hear what I have to contribute.

In addition to wanting to contribute back to the community, I'd also like to improve
my writing skills and work towards making blogging something that is easy and stress free.


# Feedback
I've grown to learn that feedback can be one of the greatest gifts to receive. 
If you have anything you'd like me to consider, please reach out to me on one my social
media accounts! Seriously, I encourage you to have a low threshold for what you consider
important to mention.

Hope you enjoy your stay, feel free to poke around!

Cheers, mate!
