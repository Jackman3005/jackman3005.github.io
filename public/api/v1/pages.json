Welcome to my new blog, code crazy. Have you ever wondered who are the great Samaritan’s of Stack Overflow who swoop in and save the day answering poor fools questions? Are they real humans? (seriously… aliens?) Because, throughout my career as a Software Engineer Consultant, I rarely find anyone willing to give back to the online community. Personally, I’ve contributed the bare minimum on stack overflow to be able to up vote answers. Over the years I have had a number of experiences that I thought the rest of the world may be interested in. I’ve mostly been too lazy to share these, but I’ve started to realize that some of my experiences are close to unique and there truly are people out there that would love to hear what I have to contribute. In addition to wanting to contribute back to the community, I’d also like to improve my writing skills and work towards making this something that is easy and not stressful. I haven’t decided if this will end up being a mix of personal and technical posts or just technical. For now I will just go with the flow and see how it goes! Why code crazy? Well.. generally, I am absolutely awful at coming up with names. I’ve been using the same character names in video games for the last decade just to avoid the stress of coming up with anything new. When I made this blog, it immediately popped into my head and I knew that I wouldn’t get another decent option even with hours of consideration. So here we are. ;)","meta":{"draft":false,"categories":["intro"],"title":"Initial Commit","date":"2018-08-07 09:28:59 +1000","layout":"post","type":"post","tags":["hello","welcome","intro"],"slug":"initial-commit","ext":".md","excerpt":"<p><strong>Hello folks!
