        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello folks! Welcome to my new blog, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code crazy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered who are the &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; Samaritan’s of Stack Overflow who swoop in 
and save the day answering poor fool’s questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are they real humans? (seriously… aliens?) Because, throughout my career as a Software Engineer Consultant,
I rarely find anyone willing to give back to the online community. Personally, I’ve 
contributed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges&quot;&gt;bare minimum on stack overflow to be able to up vote answers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have had a number of experiences that I thought the rest of the world
may be interested in. I’ve mostly been too lazy to share these, but I’ve started to realize
that some of my experiences are close to unique and there truly are people out there that
would love to hear what I have to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to wanting to contribute back to the community, I’d also like to improve
my writing skills and work towards making this something that is easy and stress free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t decided if this will end up being a mix of personal
and technical posts or just technical. For now I will just go with the flow and see
how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why code crazy?&lt;/strong&gt; Well.. generally, I am absolutely awful at coming up with names.
I’ve been using the same character names in video games for the last decade just to avoid
the stress of coming up with anything new. When I made this blog, it immediately popped into my head
and I knew that I wouldn’t get another decent option even with hours of consideration. 
So here we are. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
