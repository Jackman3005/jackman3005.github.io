This about page is rendered dynamically, all that's required for a dynamic render is putting\n```\n---\nrender: dynamic\n---\n```\nin your front matter. What this does is spit out a corresponding JSON file of your dynamic page at the url. put 'About.json' in the url to see it!\n\n\nIf you want a static render, you don't need to include anything for 'render'\n","meta":{"layout":"default","title":"About","permalink":"about/","render":"dynamic"}}
